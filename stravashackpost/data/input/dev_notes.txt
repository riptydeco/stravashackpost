s[Dev Notes:

Shit that works:
- Managing access token refreshes with Strava's oath system
- Pulling summary data from /athletes/{id}/stats
- Pulling activity data from /athlete/activities
- General activity summarization
- Calculating ride distances for indoor trainer activities
- Workaround for getting total weight lifting: Manually add weight into the activity's private notes, then pull that value
- Preemptively pull and store the activity details for each activity.  Will use this later to replace the "on demand" activity details calls.

Stuff that doesn't work:
- Garmin only allows API access for enterprise developers.  Dick move.  Total weight for weightlifting had to be calculated manually
- You can use Python to pull down the gpx/tcx files for the strength activity, but it doesn't have anything but heart rate

Stuff I haven't figured out yet:
- Calories are in /activities/{id} and can only be accessed one activity at a time.  I have loops to pull down each indivual activity for calculating distance and weight, but I'll need to start storing those locally so I don't have to make a zillion api calls each time.
