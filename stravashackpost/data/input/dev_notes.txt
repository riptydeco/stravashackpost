s[Dev Notes:

Code repository: https://github.com/riptydeco/stravashackpost

Shit that works:
- Managing access token refreshes with Strava's oath system
- Pulling summary data from /athletes/{id}/stats
- Pulling activity data from /athlete/activities
- General activity summarization
- Calculating ride distances for indoor trainer activities
- Workaround for getting total weight lifting: Manually add weight into the activity's private notes, then pull that value
- Preemptively pull and store the activity details for each activity.  Will use this later to replace the "on demand" activity details calls.
- Calculated calories from activity detail files

Stuff that doesn't work:
- Garmin only allows API access for enterprise developers.  Dick move.  Total weight for weightlifting had to be calculated manually
- You can use Python to pull down the gpx/tcx files for the strength activity, but it doesn't have anything but heart rate

To-do:
- Strava has a limit of 200 activities per result set.  Need to create a loop to deal with this... sometime before July :P
