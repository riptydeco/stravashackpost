s[Dev Notes:

Shit that works:
- Managing access token refreshes with Strava's oath system
- Pulling summary data from /athletes/{id}/stats
- Pulling activity data from /athlete/activities
- General activity summarization

Stuff that doesn't work:
- Garmin only allows API access for enterprise developers.  Dick move.  Total weight for weightlifting had to be calculated manually
- Garmin package for Python exists, but doesn't seem to actually work

Stuff I haven't figured out yet:
- Calories are in /activities/{id} and can only be accessed one activity at a time.  I'll have to build a loop to make an individual call for each activity.
